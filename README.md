# Web API Project with C# and Entity Framework

Welcome to the **Web API Project**! This is a C# web API that allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with an Entity Framework backend. The API is designed to interact with a database and manage records using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It features a simple front-end interface built with **Bootstrap** for creating and managing data tables, as well as an integrated documentation system to help developers and users navigate the API.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete records through the API.
- **Bootstrap-based UI**: A simple, responsive front-end for inserting and displaying data in table format.
- **Entity Framework Integration**: Using Entity Framework for efficient database management.
- **Basic Authentication/Authorization**: Ensures that sensitive data is protected and can only be accessed by authorized users.
- **API Documentation**: Built-in documentation to guide users and developers in utilizing the API effectively.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to follow clean and modular practices. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main folders and files:

- **Controllers**: Contains all API controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests.
- **Models**: Defines the structure of data entities used in the application.
- **Views**: Contains Bootstrap-based views for user interaction.
- **Data**: Contains Entity Framework DbContext and data models for database interaction.
- **Authentication**: Handles basic authentication and authorization mechanisms.
